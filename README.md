# üöÄ Connecting the Dots - Adobe India Hackathon 2025

## Theme: From Brains to Experience - Make It Real

### 1. How to Run Our Project

Our entire application is containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment.

**Prerequisites:**
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
* A folder containing your credentials file (e.g., `adbe-gcp.json`).

**Step 1: Build the Docker Image (Same for Mac and Windows)**

Clone the repository and build the Docker image using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t adobe-website .
```

**Step 2: Run the Docker Container**

The `run` command differs slightly between operating systems due to the way file paths are handled.

---

#### For Windows (using Command Prompt)

Use a Windows-style path. You can use `%cd%` if your `credentials` folder is in the same directory as your `Dockerfile`.

```powershell
docker run -v C:\path\to\your\credentials:/credentials \
  -e ADOBE_EMBED_API_KEY=<YOUR_ADOBE_EMBED_API_KEY> \
  -e LLM_PROVIDER=gemini \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/credentials/adbe-gcp.json \
  -e GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash \
  -e TTS_PROVIDER=azure \
  -e AZURE_TTS_KEY=<YOUR_AZURE_TTS_KEY> \
  -e AZURE_TTS_ENDPOINT=<YOUR_AZURE_TTS_ENDPOINT> \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  adobe-website
```
*Replace `C:\path\to\your\credentials` with the actual path to your credentials folder.*

---

#### For macOS / Linux

Use an absolute path for your credentials folder.

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/your/credentials:/credentials \
  -e ADOBE_EMBED_API_KEY=<YOUR_ADOBE_EMBED_API_KEY> \
  -e LLM_PROVIDER=gemini \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/credentials/adbe-gcp.json \
  -e GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash \
  -e TTS_PROVIDER=azure \
  -e AZURE_TTS_KEY=<YOUR_AZURE_TTS_KEY> \
  -e AZURE_TTS_ENDPOINT=<YOUR_AZURE_TTS_ENDPOINT> \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  adobe-website
```
*Replace `/path/to/your/credentials` with the actual absolute path to your credentials folder.*

---

Once the container is running, the application will be accessible at **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**.

### 2. Introduction & Problem Statement

In today's information-rich world, professionals, students, and researchers are inundated with vast amounts of documents. Over time, it becomes incredibly difficult to recall specific details or, more importantly, to connect insights and ideas scattered across this personal library of knowledge. Our project, **Connecting the Dots**, transforms a static document collection into an interactive and intelligent knowledge base.

### 3. Our Solution: An Insight & Engagement System

We have built a web-based PDF reading experience that helps users connect the dots between documents they've read. When a user selects a piece of text, our system instantly surfaces related, overlapping, or even contradictory information from their entire document library. By leveraging AI, we go beyond simple search to provide contextual insights, enhancing comprehension and fostering new ideas‚Äîall grounded in the user's own content.
